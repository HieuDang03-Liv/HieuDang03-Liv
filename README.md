#Hi, my name is Hieu Dang, a programmer from Vietnam.# 
I've been learning front-end technologies for 2 years, especially **ReactJS** and corresponding tools.
I've built 2 simple web apps:
- Real-time chatting app with ReactJS. Firestore for updating database, Authentication for logging.
- JavaScript sharing knowledge like *freeCodeCamp* by GatsbyJS and CodeMirror.

I'm finding for a developer job, front-end role. I'm just 18 years old, but i had more than 2 years in programming world.
Not a expert or experienced but with respect, i think it's possible to make the life better ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥
